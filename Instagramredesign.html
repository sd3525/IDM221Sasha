    <h1> Instagram Algorithm Curator Redesign</h1>

    <h2> Overview:</h2>
    <p> Instagram is an app where users not only share and view photos and videos, but also explore their interests and view content that keeps them entertained.</p>
    <h2> Problem Statement:</h2>
    <p> The explore page of Instagram has pictures, videos, and reels (videos longer than 60 seconds) that are supposed to reflect the user’s interests. I found the content on my explore page to be irrelevant to my interests, so I tested out whether or not others shared a similar viewpoint through conducting a survey on 10 of my friends who use Instagram on a daily basis:</p>

    <p> These results prove that Instagram’s explore page is not engaging enough for the average user. I figured that I could create a better system for how to narrow down the content on the explore page to be what users are genuinely interested in. This will keep users on the app longer, which will in turn help the company gain more profit. The fix could also help local businesses, because the type of customers who like their products would find the business easily through the system.</p>
    <p> Users: According to Pew Research Center, the majority of Instagram’s users are between the age 18- to 29 (this is 71% of a nationally representative survey of 1,502 U.S. adults conducted via telephone from Jan. 25-Feb.8, 2021) https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2021/04/07/social-media-use-in-2021/. I created a user persona to be able to better understand the average Instagram user:</p>

    <h2> Process</h2>
    <h3> Step #1: User Flow </h3>
    <p> I started off by creating a user flow with screenshots of the original app and adding my own algorithm creator screens to understand how a user would use the app with my new algorithm curator feature and where I could place new micro-interactions. I got my inspiration from Spotify’s Discover Weekly feature where a user can control what music suggestions they would receive on a weekly basis by liking or disliking songs.</p>

    <h3> Step #2: Branding</h3>
    <p> In order to not run into copyright issues with Instagram, I decided to change the name to Pixr as I felt that it still conveyed the main purpose of the app being centered around photos. For the logo I put 3 pixels that are red, green, and blue and made the accent colors these to reflect the basic rgb color model used in digital images. I chose the font saira and poppins because they are neutral, legible, and have a rectangular form to them which fits the pixel theme.</p>

    <h3> Step #3: Micro-interactions</h3>
    <p> I then brainstormed micro-interactions that I could include within my design and sketched out 20 possible ideas. I decided on a trash can for the posts that users dislike and a heart for posts that users like. I also wanted to include a feature where a user could chose to either message or follow the user without going into the accounts profile to streamline the process of finding the content that fits a user’s interests best. I created 10 iterations of this idea. These were my top four options:</p>

    <p> I ended up deciding on the post turning into a small picture and falling into a heart if a user tapped it and the post crumpling up into a ball and falling into the trash can if a user tapped the trash. These give clear and quick visual cues as to whether a user likes or dislikes the content in a satisfying way. For the message and follow option I put different sized pixels in place where users could choose to either message or follow the user without going into the accounts profile to streamline the process of finding the content that fits a user’s interests best. I chose the Pixels in order to stay consistent with the logo and name of the app.</p>
    <h3> Step #4: Low Fidelity Wireframes</h3>
    <p> I created low fidelity wireframes that I incorporated my final micro-interaction choices and placement of my algorithm curator in order to organize my content:</p>

    <h3> Step #4: High Fidelity Wireframes</h3>
    <p> Next I created high-fidelity wireframes that incorporated colored images of my final micro-interaction choices and placement of my algorithm curator in order to fully visualize my design before making the project screens:</p>

    <h3> Step #6: After Effects Ready Project Screens</h3>
    <p> I refined my high fidelity project screens into templates that were ready to transfer into after effects, by using AEUX:</p>

    <h3> Step #7: Animating the Micro-Interactions in After Effects</h3>
    <p> I animated how the average user would interact with the app through swipes and short and long taps.</p>

    <h2> Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Overall, this redesign encompasses the main features of Instagram and adds onto them with an algorithm curator and new micro-interactions that help the user reach their intended point of interest. The user would also now have a more personalized way of choosing the content that they want to see which also benefits the company.</p>
